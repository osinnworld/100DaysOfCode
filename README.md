## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide straightforward and well-documented C programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in programming. It serves as a reference for beginners learning C and an opportunity to practice writing and understanding code.

## Getting Started

To run the programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The most common C compiler is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available on various platforms like Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Installing GCC on Ubuntu (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Installing GCC on macOS

For macOS, you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which includes GCC.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Installing GCC on Windows

For Windows, you can use the MinGW-w64 (Minimalist GNU for Windows) project, which provides a port of GCC.

- Download MinGW-w64 installer from http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download
- Follow the installation instructions from the website.

## List of Programs

Here are the programs included in this repository:

1. [Hello World](hello_world.c): A classic "Hello, World!" program to start your C journey.
